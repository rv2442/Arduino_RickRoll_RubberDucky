# Arduino_RickRoll_RubberDucky

Arduino as a rubber ducky which rick rolls
>1. Rick Rolls.    
>2. gives an alert by running a powershell script saying that the user has been hacked.    
>3. Shuts off the PC.   

This was made just for fun, if you end up injecting a malware using this ducky library, do let me know.  
Would be interesting seeing the potential of ducky scripts.
